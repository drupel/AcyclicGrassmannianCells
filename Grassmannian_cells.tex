\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
  We prove that all quiver Grassmannians for exceptional representations of an acyclic quiver admit a cell decomposition.  
  In the process, we introduce a class of regular representations which arise as quotients of consecutive exceptional representations in an exceptional sequence.
  Cell decompositions for quiver Grassmannians of these ``truncated exceptionals'' are also established. 
  The cells admit a natural combinatorial labeling in terms of 2-quivers.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Given two tuples $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ and $y=(y_1,\ldots,y_m)$, we write $x\smile y$ for their concatenation $(x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m)$. (better notation?)

    In this case, we write $\cW/\cU=(W_1/U_1,\ldots,W_n/U_n)$ and set $\codim_\cW(\cU)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dim(W_i/U_i)$.

\section{Exceptional sequences}

A representation $X$ is \emph{exceptional} if $X$ is indecomposable and rigid, i.e.\ $\Ext(X,X)=0$.
A sequence of exceptional representations $(X_1,\ldots,X_k)$ is \emph{exceptional} itself if $\Hom(X_i,X_j)=0=\Ext(X_i,X_j)$ for $i<j$.
An immediate consequence of the definition is that an exceptional sequence must consist of non-isomorphic representations. 
An exceptional sequence $(X_1,\ldots,X_k)$ is \emph{$\Ext$-orthogonal} (resp.\ \emph{$\Hom$-orthogonal}) if $\Ext(X_i,X_j)=0$ (resp. $\Hom(X_i,X_j)=0$) for all $i,j$.

An exceptional sequence $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ consisting of $n=|Q_0|$ exceptional representations is called \emph{complete}.
A (non-)complete $\Ext$-orthogonal exceptional sequence $(X_1,\ldots,X_k)$ determines a (partial) tilting representation $X_1\oplus\cdots\oplus X_k$. 
As any exceptional representation $X$ can be completed to tilting representation \cite{???}, every exceptional representation can be found in a complete exceptional sequence.
We will see below that this may be done with $X$ in any position of the sequence. 

Without loss of generality we will assume $Q_0=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ is labeled along a \emph{sink adapted sequence}, i.e.\ vertex 1 is a sink in $Q$ and $(2,\ldots,n)$ is sink adapted for the quiver obtained from $Q$ by removing vertex 1 and all arrows incident to this vertex.
Then we have a canonical $\Hom$-orthogonal exceptional sequence $(S_1,\ldots,S_n)$.
A remarkable result of Crawley-Boevey shows that all complete exceptional sequences may be obtained from this standard sequence by an action of the braid group.

Given an exceptional sequence $(X,Y)$, write $\cC(X,Y)$ for the full subcategory of $\rep Q$ containing $X$ and $Y$ which is closed under taking direct sums, kernels, and cokernels.
It is well-known \cite{???} that the category $\cC(X,Y)$ is isomorphic to the category of representations for a generalized Kronecker quiver.
In this subcategory the exceptional sequences are easy to describe, namely they are either the canonical $\Hom$-orthogonal exceptional sequence or a slice of either the preprojetive of preinjective component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of $\cC(X,Y)$.
The braid group action is then given by either replacing an odd slice by an even slice or by replacing the projective or injective slice with the $\Hom$-orthogonal exceptional sequence.


\subsection{Quiver Grassmannian Fibrations from Exceptional Sequences}

Fix a complete exceptional sequence $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$.
Write $S_1^{(i)}$ and $S_2^{(i)}$ for the simple projective and simple injective repectively in the category $\cC(X_i,X_{i+1})$.
Given a representation $X\in\cC(X_i,X_{i+1})$, write $\Gr^{(i)}_{e_1,e_2}(X)$ for the projective variety of subrepresentations $E\subset X$ with $E\in\cC(X_i,X_{i+1})$.
Then there is a map
\[\Gr_\bfe(X)\to\bigsqcup_{e_1,e_2} \Gr^{(i)}_{e_1,e_2}(X)\]
given by forgetting the summands of a subrepresentation $E\subset X$ which do not lie in $\cC(X_i,X_{i+1})$.

What can we say about the fibers of this map?

\section{Truncated Preprojectives}

Let $Q=(Q_0,Q_1,s,t)$ be a connected acyclic quiver, to avoid special cases we assume $Q$ is not of finite representation type.
Given a sink or source $k\in Q_0$, write $\mu_k Q$ for the quiver obtained from $Q$ by reversing all arrows incident to vertex $k$.
Without loss of generality, we will assume the vertex set $Q_0=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ is labeled along a \emph{sink adapted sequence}, i.e.~vertex 1 is a sink in $Q$, vertex $2$ is a sink in $\mu_1 Q$, vertex $3$ is a sink in $\mu_2\mu_1 Q$, etc.
Observe that this implies vertex $n$ is a source in $Q$, vertex $n-1$ is a source in $\mu_n Q$, vertex~$n-2$ is a source in $\mu_{n-1}\mu_n Q$, etc.

For $i,j\in Q_0$, we introduce the following notation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $Q_1(i,-)$ is the set of arrows $\alpha\in Q_1$ with source $s(\alpha)=i$ and $Q_0(i,-)$ is the set of targets $t(\alpha)$ for all such arrows;
  \item $Q_1(-,j)$ is the set of arrows $\alpha\in Q_1$ with target $t(\alpha)=j$ and $Q_0(-,j)$ is the set of sources $s(\alpha)$ for all such arrows;
  \item $Q_1(i,j)=Q_1(i,-)\cap Q_1(-,j)$ is the set of arrows $\alpha\in Q_1$ with $s(\alpha)=i$ and $t(\alpha)=j$;
  \item write $b_{ij}=|Q_1(i,j)|$ for the number of arrows from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$.
\end{itemize}

For $i,\ell\in Q_0$, an arrow $\alpha\in Q_1(i,\ell)\cup Q_1(\ell,i)$ is called a \emph{limb arrow} and $\ell$ is a \emph{limb vertex} with respect to vertex $i$ if removing $\alpha$ from $Q$ creates a disconnected quiver in which the component containing vertex $\ell$ is an orientation of a Dynkin diagram of type A.\sayT{$\ell$ itself should probably be a leaf of this component? Or do we want to include cases where $\ell$ is a middle vertex of a type $A$ component?}
A special case of a limb is a \emph{leaf} of $Q$ which is a vertex $\ell\in Q_0$ with $|Q_1(\ell,-)\cup Q_1(-,\ell)|=1$.

Note that each limb vertex $\ell\in Q_0$ has a uniquely associated leaf vertex $\ell'$ of~$Q$ lying at the opposite end of its type A component, if $\ell$ itself is a leaf of $Q$ then $\ell'=\ell$.
Once a limb vertex $\ell$ is specified, the type A component associated to $\ell$ is uniquely determined (we assume $Q$ itself is not of type A).
In the type A subquiver $Q(\ell)\subset Q$ obtained by adjoining the limb arrow $\alpha$ to this component, each arrow is directed either toward vertex $i$ or toward vertex $\ell'$.
We write $h(\ell)$ for the total number of arrows in the quiver $Q(\ell)$ directed toward vertex $i$.

For a sink or source vertex $k\in Q_0$, write $\Sigma_k:\rep Q\to\rep \mu_k Q$ for the BGP-reflection functor \cite{BGP??} (see also \cite{APR??} for an equivalent formulation known as APR-tilting).
Note that we use the same symbol $\Sigma$ to denote the reflection functor associated to a sink or a source and also for the reflection functors associated to any reflection of $Q$.
In particular, the functor $\Sigma_k^2$ is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor when restricted to the full subcategory $\rep^{\langle k\rangle} Q\subset\rep Q$ consisting of representations with no summand isomorphic to the vertex simple $S_k$.
Moreover, the reflection functor $\Sigma_k:\rep^{\langle k\rangle} Q\to\rep^{\langle k\rangle} \mu_k Q$ is an exact equivalence of categories \cite{DR76}.
Recall that the \emph{Auslander-Reiten translation} $\tau:\rep Q\to\rep Q$ is naturally isomorphic to the product of reflection functors $\Sigma_n\cdots\Sigma_1$ \cite{BB??}.

For $i\in Q_0$, write $P_i$ for the projective cover of the simple $S_i$ and write $I_i$ for its injective hull.
These representations are constructed inductively via $P_i=\Sigma_1\cdots\Sigma_{i-1}S_i$ (resp.~via $I_i=\Sigma_n\cdots\Sigma_{i+1}S_i$), where $S_i$ here denotes the vertex simple of the quiver $\mu_{i-1}\cdots\mu_1 Q$ (resp.~of the quiver $\mu_{i+1}\cdots\mu_n Q$).
%For $i,j\in Q_0$, write $\Irr(P_i,P_j)\subset\Hom(P_i,P_j)$ for the subspace of morphisms which have no nontrivial factorization through a projective $P_k$ with $k\ne i,j$. 
%\begin{lemma}
%  For $i,j\in Q_0$, we have $\dim\Irr(P_j,P_i)=b_{ij}$.
%\end{lemma}
The \emph{preprojective} (resp.~\emph{preinjective}) representations $P_{i,m}$ (resp.~$I_{i,m}$) for $i\in Q_0$ and $m\in\ZZ_{\ge0}$ are defined inductively by
\[P_{i,0}=P_i,\qquad P_{i,m+1}=\tau^{-1} P_{i,m},\qquad I_{i,0}=I_i,\qquad I_{i,m+1}=\tau I_{i,m}.\]
More generally, we say a representation $M\in\rep Q$ is \emph{preprojective} (resp.~\emph{preinjective}) if $\tau^r M=0$ (resp. if~$\tau^{-r} M=0$) for some $r>0$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:preprojective ext groups}
  For $i,j,k\in Q_0$ with $|Q_1(i,j)|\ne0$ and $m\ge0$, we have 
  \[\Ext(P_{k,m},P_{i,m})=0 \qquad \text{and} \qquad \Ext(P_{j,m+1},P_{i,m})=0.\]
\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%  The first claim for $m=0$ is immediate since the representations $P_{i,0}$ are projective, for $m>0$ this follows by applying Auslander-Reiten translations.
%  The second claim may be reduced to the case $m=0$ and $j$ a sink in $Q$ using Auslander-Reiten translations and reflection functors.
%\end{proof}
For two dimension vectors $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we denote by $\hom(\alpha,\beta)$ the minimal and thus general value if $\dim\Hom:R_\alpha(Q)\times R_\beta(Q)\to \NN$, see \cite{sch} for more details.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem: non-preinjective}
If $M,N\in\rep(Q)$ are indecomposable such that $\udim M$ is an imaginary root and such that $\Hom(N,M)\neq 0$, then $N$ is not preinjective. In particular, if $\hom(\alpha,\beta)\neq 0$ and $\beta$ is an imaginary Schur root, $\alpha$ is not the dimension vector of a preinjective representation.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
As $\udim M$ is imaginary, $M$ is a regular representation. Indeed all preinjectives and preprojective indecomposable representations are exceptional. But if $N$ were preinjective, we had $\Hom(N,M)\neq 0$ only for preinjectives $M$.

Finally, if $\beta$ is a Schur root, then a general representation is indecomposable which gives the second part.
\end{proof}
For a dimension vector $\alpha\in\NN^{Q_0}$, we write $\alpha=\sum_{q\in Q_0}\alpha_q q$.
\begin{proposition}\label{pro:simpleregular}
Let $Q$ be any acyclic quiver which is not of Dynkin type and let $\ell\in Q_0$. % be neither a sink nor a source. 
%Then $S_\ell$ is preprojective if and only if there exists a unique limb vertex $n\in Q_1(\ell,-)$ and 
Then $S_\ell$ is preinjective if one of the following cases holds: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $|Q_1(-,\ell)|=0$;
\item $|Q_1(-,\ell)|=1$ and  removing all arrows $\alpha\in Q_1(\ell,-)$ creates a disconnected component $Q'$ containing $\ell$ which is of type $A$. \sayT{to get if and only if we probably have to go for Dynkin type here}
\end{enumerate}
Moreover, $S_\ell$ is not preinjective if $|Q_1(-,\ell)|\geq 2$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}

If $Q_1(-,\ell)=0$, then $\ell$ is a source of $Q$ and thus $S_\ell$ is injective. Thus assume that $|Q_1(-,\ell)|=1$ and let $Q'$ be the connected component containing $\ell$ after removing all arrows $\alpha\in Q_1(\ell,-)$ which is by assumption of type $A$. 
%First assume that there exists a vertex $n$ such that after removing all arrows $\alpha:\ell\to n$, the vertex $\ell$ is a leaf of a quiver $Q'\subset Q$ of type $A_m$.
Denote the vertices of $Q'$ by $\{1,2,\ldots,m-1\}\cup\{\ell\}$ with arrows between vertices $i$ and $i+1$ for $i=1,\ldots m-2$ and $m-1$ and $\ell$. As $\ell$ is a sink of $Q'$, at least one of the vertices $1,\ldots,m-1$ is a source. Let $q$ be the maximal source of $Q'$, i.e. closest to $\ell$. Then all arrows from $q$ to $\ell$ are oriented towards $\ell$. Then it is easy to check that the representation $\Sigma_{m-1}\ldots\Sigma_{q} S_\ell$ is an injective representation of $\mu_{m-1}\ldots\mu_{q}Q$ of dimension $(m-1)+\ell$. As we did only reflect at sources of  $Q_0'\backslash\{\ell\}$ and as $Q_1(-,\ell)=\{m-1\}$, this already shows that $S_\ell$ is a preinjective representation of $Q$.

%Thus assume that $\ell$ is not a source and satisfies the following condition:  If $|Q_1(-,\ell)|=1$, the connected component $Q'$ obtained after removing all vertices  $\alpha\in Q_1(\ell,-)$ is not of type $A$. 
Thus let $Q_1(-,\ell)\geq 2$. If there is no outgoing arrow from $\ell$ to some vertex $n$, it follows that $S_\ell$ is projective and thus not preinjective as $Q$ is not of Dynkin type. Thus assume that there exists a vertex $n$ such that $|Q_1(\ell,n)|\geq 1$. By assumption, there exists at least two arrows $\alpha:q\to\ell$ and $\alpha':q'\to\ell$ for some $q,q'\in Q_0$.  Note that $q,q'\neq n$ as $Q$ is acyclic. 

First assume that $q=q'$. Then the root $q+\ell$ is imaginary with $\hom(\ell,q+\ell)=1$ and thus $S_\ell$ is not preinjective by Lemma \ref{lem: non-preinjective}.
Thus assume that $q\neq q'$ and $Q_1(i,\ell)=1$ for $i\in\{q,q'\}$. If $Q_1(\ell,n)\geq 2$, we may consider the imaginary root $\beta=q+q'+3\ell+n$ for which we have $\hom(\ell,\beta)\geq 1$. Again this shows that $S_\ell$ is not preinjective by Lemma \ref{lem: non-preinjective}.

Next assume that $Q_1(\ell,n)=1$. If there were a vertex $n'\notin \{n,q,q'\}$ such that $Q_1(n',\ell)\cup Q_1(\ell,n')=1$, the full subquiver $Q'$ with vertices $\{\ell,n,n',q,q'\}$ would be of type $\tilde D_4$ with middle vertex $\ell$ which is neither a source nor a sink. Then it is straightforward that $S_\ell$ is regular as a representation of $Q'$. In particular, there exists an indecomposable imaginary root representation $X$ in the same tube which is of dimension $\delta=n+n'+q+q'+2\ell$ and such that $\Hom(S_\ell,X)\neq 0$. As we clearly have $\dim\Ext_Q(X,X)\geq \dim\Ext_{Q'}(X,X)\neq 0$, we can again apply Lemma \ref{lem: non-preinjective}.

Thus assume that there does not exist such a vertex $n'$. Thus $\ell$ has precisely three neighbors $q,q'$ and $n$.
If $q$ is connected to $q'$ by a sequence of vertices $q=q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_r=q'$ with $q_i\neq n$, it is easy to check that $\beta=\sum_{i=1}^rq_i$ is an imaginary Schur root with $\hom(\ell,\beta)\neq 0$. If $n$ is connected to $q$ (or $q'$) by a sequence as above, denoting the arrow from $\ell$ to $n$ by $\gamma$, there exists an imaginary Schur root $X$ representation of dimension $\beta=\sum_{i=1}^{r}q_i$ with $X_\gamma=0$ which implies $\Hom(S_\ell,X_\gamma)\neq 0$. Thus Lemma \ref{lem: non-preinjective} yields the claim. 

Thus we may additionally assume that the arrows $q,q'$ and $n$ are only connected by a unique walk. If $Q$ has another vertex with at least three neighbors, it is straightforward to check that it has a subquiver of extended Dynkin type $D$ in which case a similar argument as in the $\tilde D_4$ case applies.\sayT{more precise}

Thus it remains to consider the case when $Q$ is a flag quiver with central vertex $\ell$. If $Q$ is not a tree, the root 
$$2\ell+\sum_{q\in Q_0\backslash\{\ell\}}q$$
is imaginary with $\hom(\ell,\beta)\neq 0$ and Lemma \ref{lem: non-preinjective} applies. Thus assume that $Q$ is a tree. As it is not of Dynkin type, it contains an extended Dynkin quiver of type $E$. But then it is straightforward that $\hom(\ell,\delta)\neq 0$ for the respective imaginary Schur roots $\delta$, see \cite[Section 4]{CB} for a list.
Thus again Lemma \ref{lem: non-preinjective} applies.

\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:nonlimb extensions}
  Suppose $\ell\in Q_0(n,-)$ is not a limb vertex with respect to the source vertex $n$.
  Then any nontrivial extension $E\in\Ext(S_n,P_{\ell,0})$ is indecomposable and not preinjective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Recall that $\dim (P_{\ell,0})_n$ is the number of paths from $\ell$ to $n$.
  As there is an arrow from $n$ to $\ell$ and as $Q$ is acyclic, we have $\dim (P_{\ell,0})_n=0$.
  By assumption, we have a non-split exact sequence
  \[\ses{P_{\ell,0}}{E}{S_n}.\]
  Since $\Hom(P_{\ell,0},S_n)=0$, applying $\Hom(P_{\ell,0},-)$ to this sequence shows $\Hom(P_{\ell,0},E)\cong\Hom(P_{\ell,0},P_{\ell,0})$ is one-dimensional.
  Since $S_n$ is injective, we have $\Hom(S_n,E)=0$ and thus applying $\Hom(-,E)$ to the sequence above shows that $\End(E)$ is also one-dimensional, in particular $E$ must be indecomposable.

  Using that $P_{\ell,0}$ and $S_n$ are exceptional and $\Sc{P_{\ell,0}}{S_n}=0$, we obtain
  $$\Sc{\udim E}{\udim E}=\Sc{\udim P_{\ell,0}+S_n}{\udim P_{\ell,0}+S_n}=2-\Sc{S_n}{P_{\ell,0}}=2-\dim\Ext(S_n,P_{\ell,0}).$$
  If $\dim\Ext(S_n,P_{\ell,0})\geq 2$, it follows that $\udim E$ is an imaginary Schur root and thus $E$ is not preinjective.

  Thus assume that $\dim\Ext(S_n,P_{\ell,0})=1$.
  This implies $\ell$ is the only vertex in the support of $P_{\ell,0}$ which is a neighbor of $n$ and $|Q_1(n,\ell)|=1$, otherwise we could again conclude that $\dim\Ext(S_n,P_{\ell,0})\geq 2$.
  Let $Q'\subset Q$ denote the support quiver of $E$ and label $Q'_0=\{i_1,\ldots,i_r\}$ along a sink adapted sequence for $Q'$.
  Then by definition of $P_{\ell,0}$ we must have $i_r=n$ and $i_{r-1}=\ell$.
  It follows that 
  $$P_{\ell,0}=\Sigma_{i_1}\cdots\Sigma_{i_{r-2}} S_\ell \qquad \text{and} \qquad E=\Sigma_{i_1}\cdots\Sigma_{i_{r-2}}\Sigma_\ell S_n=\Sigma_{i_1}\cdots\Sigma_{i_{r-2}}\Sigma_n S_\ell=\Sigma_n\Sigma_{i_1}\cdots\Sigma_{i_{r-2}} S_\ell.$$
 

% in particular $E$ is projective as a representation of $Q'$.
 % It follows that $E$ is not injective as a representation of $Q$.
 % Indeed, this would imply that $E$ is injective as a representation of $Q'$, but as $\ell$ is not a limb vertex, $Q'$ is not of type A and thus $Q'$ does not admit a projective-injective representation.
  %\sayD{I am not sure why $E$ having a one-dimensional space at vertex $n$ implies it is not strictly preinjective.}
	%It follows that $\Sigma_n\Sigma_{i_{r-1}}\cdots\Sigma_{i_1} E\cong S_\ell$ as representations of $\mu_n\mu_{i_{r-1}}\cdots\mu_{i_1} Q$.
  As $\ell$ is not a limb vertex and a sink of $Q'$ and thus of the full subquiver with vertices $Q_0\backslash\{n\}$, there exist at least two arrows $\alpha:q\to \ell$ and $\alpha':q'\to \ell$ with $q,q'\neq n$. Thus we have $Q_1(-,\ell)\geq 2$. But now Proposition \ref{pro:simpleregular} shows that $S_\ell=\Sigma_n E$ and thus $E$
	
	
  %As $n$ was a source of $Q$, it follows that $n$ is a sink of $\mu_n\mu_{\ell-1}\cdots\mu_{1} Q$.
  %In turn $\ell$ is neither sink nor source and thus $S_{\ell}$ is not preinjective because we assumed that $Q$ is not of Dynkin type.
  %\sayT{(why) is this true? Make this precise}
  %\sayD{Here is an argument, is there a shorter one? The dimension vector of a preinjective representation is a positive root of the form $c^rs_n\cdots s_{i+1}\alpha_i$ where $c=s_n\cdots s_1$ is a Coxeter element.  If $Q$ is not of finite representation type, then a Coxeter element is not of finite order and thus $\alpha_\ell$ cannot be the dimension vector of a preinjective representation.}
  %Thus $E$ is also not preinjective.
%  For sake of contradiction, suppose $E$ is preinjective, say $E\cong \tau^r\Sigma_n\cdots\Sigma_{k+1} S_k$ for some $k\in Q_0$ and some~$r\ge0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  Suppose $Q_0(n,-)=\{\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_p\}$ consists entirely of limb vertices with respect to the source vertex $n$.
  Then for any proper subset $\{i_1,\ldots,i_q\}\subset[1,p]$ with $q\ge2$, any indecomposable extension $E\in\Ext(S_n,P_{\ell_{i_1},0}\oplus\cdots\oplus P_{\ell_{i_q},0})$ is not preinjective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  First note that $Q$ is not of finite representation type and so $p\ge3$.
  Let $\ell'_i$, $i=1,\ldots,p$, denote the leaf vertex of $Q$ in the subquiver $Q(\ell_i)\subset Q$.
  Write $r_i$, $i=1,\ldots,p$, for the number of arrows in $Q(\ell_i)$ directed towards $\ell'_i$.
  
  If $q=2$, there exists a commutative diagram
  \[\xymatrix{
      & & 0 \ar[d] & 0 \ar[d] & \\
      & & P_{\ell_{i_1},0} \ar@{=}[r]\ar[d] & P_{\ell_{i_1},0} \ar[d] & \\
      0 \ar[r] & P_{\ell_{i_2},0} \ar[r]\ar@{=}[d] & E \ar[r]\ar[d]\ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner} & I_{\ell'_{i_1},0} \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
      0 \ar[r] & P_{\ell_{i_2},0} \ar[r] & I_{\ell'_{i_2},0} \ar[r]\ar[d] & S_n \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
      & & 0 & 0 & 
    }\]
  Since the upper horizontal morphism (or the left hand vertical morphism) is an equality, the lower right square is a pullback and thus there exists an exact sequence
  \[\ses{E}{I_{\ell'_{i_1},0}\oplus I_{\ell'_{i_2},0}}{S_n}.\]
  This sequence is not split since $E\not\cong I_{\ell'_{i_1},0},I_{\ell'_{i_2},0}$ and so $E$ is not injective.
  If we can show in this case that $E$ is not strictly preinjective, then the general case follows by applying Lemma~\ref{le:nonpreinjective extensions} below.

  It may be useful to make the following reduction:

  If $q=p-1$, say index $j$ is not included in the subset, then an easy calculation shows that $E\cong\tau^{-r_j}P_{\ell'_j,0}$ is preprojective.
  Since $Q$ is not of finite representation type, this implies $E$ is not preinjective.

  The argument above in particular gives the full claim for $p=3$ and thus we assume $p\ge4$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:nonpreinjective extensions}
  If $M\in\rep Q$ is indecomposable and not preinjective, then any extension $E\in\Ext(M,P_{i,m})$ of $M$ by a preprojective representation $P_{i,m}$ contains no preinjective summand.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  For sake of contradiction, assume $E$ contains a preinjective summand.

  By assumption, the quiver $Q$ is not of finite representation type so that $P_{i,m}$ is not preinjective for any $i\in Q_0$ and $m\ge0$.
  Therefore, after an APR-tilt, we may assume $E$ actually contains a simple injective summand, say $E\cong E'\oplus S_k$ for a source $k\in Q_0$.
  Since $M$ is indecomposable and not injective, this $S_k$ component must lie in the kernel of the projection $E\onto M$.
  That is, we have $S_k\subset P_{i,m}$ which implies $S_k$ is a summand of $P_{i,m}$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

In the definitions that follow we will need to identify particularly nice subsets of $\Hom_Q(P_{i,m},P_{j,m})$ and of $\Hom_Q(P_{i,m},P_{j,m+1})$.
To do this efficiently, we introduce the universal covering quiver $\widetilde{Q}$ of $Q$.
\begin{definition}
  Let $W=W(Q)$ denote the free group generated by the arrows $\alpha\in Q_1$ of $Q$.
  The \emph{universal covering quiver} of $Q$ is the quiver $\widetilde{Q}$ with vertices $(i,w)$ for $i\in Q_0$ and $w\in W$, and arrows $(\alpha,w):\big(s(\alpha),w\big)\to \big(t(\alpha),w \alpha \big)$ for $\alpha\in Q_1$ and $w\in W$.
\end{definition}
There is a natural forgetful functor $F:\rep\widetilde{Q}\to\rep Q$ and we say $M\in\rep Q$ \emph{lifts to $\widetilde{Q}$} if there exists $\widetilde{M}\in\rep\widetilde{Q}$ with $F(\widetilde{M})=M$.
Below, when we assume that a representation $M$ lifts to $\widetilde{Q}$, we will also implicitly assume that such a lift $\widetilde{M}$ has been chosen.
This forgetful functor intertwines the action of the reflection functor $\Sigma_k:\rep Q\to\rep Q$ for $k$ a sink (resp.~source) vertex with the action of the composite reflection functor $\widetilde{\Sigma}_k:\rep\widetilde{Q}\to\rep\widetilde{Q}$ given by applying all reflections $\Sigma_{(k,w)}$, $w\in W$, associated to sinks (resp.~sources) of $\widetilde{Q}$ covering vertex $k$ of $Q$.
Analogously, the Auslander-Reiten translation $\tilde\tau:\rep\widetilde{Q}\to\rep\widetilde{Q}$ is naturally isomorphic to the product $\widetilde{\Sigma}_n\cdots\widetilde{\Sigma}_1$ and thus the actions of $\tau$ and $\tilde{\tau}$ are also intertwined by $F$. 

Each projective representation $P_i$, $i\in Q_0$, admits a canonical lift $\widetilde{P}_i$ which is symmetric with respect to permutations about the central vertex $(i,e)$; this can be obtained using the intertwined reflection functors of $\widetilde{Q}$ as described above.
By applying Auslander-Reiten translations on the universal covering quiver, we obtain the same claim for each preprojective representation $P_{i,m}$ for $i\in Q_0$ and $m\ge0$.

There is a natural action of $W$ on $\widetilde{Q}$ given on vertices by $w.(i,w')=(i,ww')$ and on arrows by $w.(\alpha,w')=(\alpha,ww')$.
This induces an action of $W$ on $\rep\widetilde{Q}$ which we denote by $\widetilde{M}\mapsto w.\widetilde{M}$ for a representation $\widetilde{M}\in\rep\widetilde{Q}$ and $w\in W$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:hom lifts}
  Given representations $M,N\in\rep Q$ which lift to $\widetilde{Q}$, there is an isomorphism 
  \[\Hom_Q(M,N)\cong\bigoplus\limits_{w\in W} \Hom_{\widetilde{Q}}(w.\widetilde{M},\widetilde{N}).\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}
  For $i,j\in Q_0$ and $m\ge0$, the spaces 
  \[\Hom_{\widetilde{Q}}(\alpha.\widetilde{P}_{j,m},\widetilde{P}_{i,m})\qquad\text{and}\qquad\Hom_{\widetilde{Q}}(\alpha^{-1}.\widetilde{P}_{i,m},\widetilde{P}_{j,m+1})\]
  for $\alpha\in Q_1(i,j)$ are both one-dimensional.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  For $m=0$ and $j$ a sink in $Q$, both claims are immediate from the definitions via reflection functors.
  For $m>0$ and $j$ arbitrary, these follow from the first case inductively by applying reflection functors.
  \sayD{This requires the cokernels to not be preinjective, why does that have to be true?}
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
  For $i,j\in Q_0$ and $m\ge0$, write $\Irr(P_{j,m},P_{i,m})\subset\Hom_Q(P_{j,m},P_{i,m})$ for the subspace corresponding to $\bigoplus_{\alpha\in Q_1(i,j)} \Hom_{\widetilde{Q}}(\alpha.\widetilde{P}_{j,m},\widetilde{P}_{i,m})$ in Lemma~\ref{le:hom lifts}.
  Similarly, let $\Irr(P_{i,m},P_{j,m+1})\subset\Hom_Q(P_{i,m},P_{j,m+1})$ denote the subspace corresponding to $\bigoplus_{\alpha\in Q_1(i,j)} \Hom_{\widetilde{Q}}(\alpha^{-1}.\widetilde{P}_{i,m},\widetilde{P}_{j,m+1})$ in Lemma~\ref{le:hom lifts}.
\end{definition}
\begin{corollary}
  For $i,j\in Q_0$ and $m\ge0$, the morphism spaces $\Irr(P_{j,m},P_{i,m})$ and $\Irr(P_{i,m},P_{j,m+1})$ are both $b_{ij}$-dimensional.
\end{corollary}
\begin{remark}
  The notation $\Irr(P_{j,m},P_{i,j})$ and $\Irr(P_{i,m},P_{j,m+1})$ is justified by the following observation: these spaces map isomorphically to the appropriate spaces $\Rad(M,N)/\Rad^2(M,N)$ of irreducible morphisms labeling arrows in the Auslander-Reiten quiver of $Q$.
  For the results that follow, it will be important to have honest morphisms and we fix these particular choices of lifts from such quotient spaces.
\end{remark}

For $k\in Q_0$, we take $P_{k,-1}=0$.
\begin{definition}
  For $i\in Q_0$ and $m\in\ZZ_{\ge-1}$, consider the tuple of representations 
  \[\cP_{i,m}=\big(P_{k,m}\big)_{k\in Q_0(-,i)} \smile\big(P_{j,m+1}\big)_{j\in Q_0(i,-)}\]
  and the tuple of vector spaces 
  \[\cI_{i,m}=\big(\Irr(P_{k,m},P_{i,m+1})\big)_{k\in Q_0(-,i)} \smile\big(\Irr(P_{j,m+1},P_{i,m+1})\big)_{j\in Q_0(i,-)}.\]
  We write $\cP_{i,m}\bullet\cI_{i,m}$ for the representation
  \[\bigoplus_{k\in Q_0(-,i)} P_{k,m}\otimes \Irr(P_{k,m},P_{i,m+1}) \oplus \bigoplus_{j\in Q_0(i,-)} P_{j,m+1}\otimes\Irr(P_{j,m+1},P_{i,m+1}).\]
  Call a tuple of subspaces $\cV\subsetneq\cI_{i,m}$ \emph{admissible} if $\cP_{i,m}\bullet(\cI_{i,m}/\cV)$ is not isomorphic to $P_{\ell,m}$ nor to $P_{\ell,m+1}$ for any vertex $\ell\in Q_0$ which is a limb with respect to $i$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:standard AR sequences}
  \mbox{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For $i\in Q_0$, there exists an exact sequence
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:projective AR}
        \ses{\cP_{i,-1}\bullet\cI_{i,-1}}{P_{i,0}}{S_i}.
      \end{equation}
    \item For $i\in Q_0$ and $m\in\ZZ_{\ge0}$, there exists an Auslander-Reiten sequence
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:preprojective AR}
        \ses{P_{i,m}}{\cP_{i,m}\bullet\cI_{i,m}}{P_{i,m+1}}.
      \end{equation}
      %\begin{equation}
      %  \label{eq:preprojective AR}
      %  \ses{P_{i,m}}{\bigoplus\limits_{k\in Q_1(-,i)} P_{k,m}\otimes\Irr(P_{k,m},P_{i,m+1})\oplus\bigoplus\limits_{j\in Q_1(i,-)} P_{j,m+1}\otimes \Irr(P_{j,m+1},P_{i,m+1})}{P_{i,m+1}};
      %\end{equation}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Part (2) can be reduced to the case $m=0$ by applying Auslander-Reiten translations and then to the case where vertex $i$ is a sink in $Q$ using reflection functors.
  Thus it suffices to establish the existence of an Auslander-Reiten sequence 
  \[\ses{P_{i,0}}{\bigoplus\limits_{k\in Q_0(-,i)} P_{k,0}\otimes\Irr(P_{k,0},P_{i,1})}{P_{i,1}}\]
  when $i\in Q_0$ is a sink.
  This sequence and the one from part (1) follow immediately from the definitions $P_{k,0}:=\Sigma_1\cdots\Sigma_{k-1} S_k$ and $P_{i,1}:=\Sigma_1\cdots\Sigma_n P_{i,0}$.
\end{proof}

The sequences \eqref{eq:projective AR} and \eqref{eq:preprojective AR} are essential for the results to follow.
In some cases, the left hand term $P_{i,m}$ in \eqref{eq:preprojective AR} surjects onto one of the summands of the middle term and the sequence \eqref{eq:preprojective AR} will not serve our purposes.
The next results describe situations when this will occur and provide the correct alternative sequences to consider.
\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:thin sequences}
  Suppose $i\in Q_0$ is adjacent to a limb vertex $\ell$ with associated leaf $\ell'$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $\ell\in Q_0(i,-)$, then for any $m\ge h(\ell)$, we have an exact sequence
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:thin limb sequence 1}
        \ses{P_{\ell',m-h(\ell)}}{P_{i,m}}{P_{\ell,m+1}}.
      \end{equation}
    \item If $\ell\in Q_0(-,i)$, then for any $m\ge h(\ell)$, we have an exact sequence
      \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:thin source sequence}
        \ses{P_{\ell',m-h(\ell)}}{P_{i,m}}{P_{\ell,m}}.
      \end{equation}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  We work by simultaneous induction on $h(\ell)$ and $m$.
  When $h(\ell)=0$, the type A quiver $Q(\ell)$ is linearly oriented from vertex $i$ to the leaf $\ell'$, in particular $\ell\in Q_0(i,-)$ and $\ell'$ is a sink of $Q$.

  If $\ell'=\ell$, then Lemma~\ref{le:standard AR sequences} gives the desired exact sequence
  \[\ses{P_{\ell,m}}{P_{i,m}}{P_{\ell,m+1}}\]
  for $m\ge0$.
  When $\ell'\ne\ell$, there exists $\ell''\in Q_0(\ell,-)$ which is itself a limb vertex with respect to $\ell$ and by induction we obtain an exact sequence
  \[\ses{P_{\ell',m}}{P_{\ell,m}}{P_{\ell'',m+1}}\]
  for $m\ge0$.
  Lemma~\ref{le:standard AR sequences} gives us an exact sequence
  \[\ses{P_{\ell,m}}{P_{i,m}\oplus P_{\ell'',m+1}}{P_{\ell,m+1}}\]
  which reduces to the desired sequence using Lemma~\ref{le:sequence reducing}.

  Now assume $h(\ell)>0$.
  If $\ell'=\ell$, then $\ell\in Q_0(-,i)$ is a source of $Q$.
  In this case, Lemma~\ref{le:standard AR sequences} gives the desired exact sequence
  \[\ses{P_{\ell,m}}{P_{i,m+1}}{P_{\ell,m+1}}\]
  for $m\ge0$.
  
  Assume $\ell'\ne\ell$.
  Write $\ell''$ for the limb vertex with respect to $\ell$.
  Then there are several cases to consider.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $\ell\in Q_0(i,-)$ and $\ell''\in Q_0(\ell,-)$, then $h(\ell'')=h(\ell)$ and by induction we obtain an exact sequence
      \[\ses{P_{\ell',m-h(\ell)}}{P_{\ell,m}}{P_{\ell'',m+1}}\]
      for $m\ge h(\ell)$.
      Lemma~\ref{le:standard AR sequences} gives an exact sequence
      \[\ses{P_{\ell,m}}{P_{i,m}\oplus P_{\ell'',m+1}}{P_{\ell,m+1}}\]
      which reduces to the desired sequence using Lemma~\ref{le:sequence reducing}.
    \item If $\ell\in Q_0(i,-)$ and $\ell''\in Q_0(-,\ell)$, then $h(\ell'')=h(\ell)$ and by induction we obtain an exact sequence
      \[\ses{P_{\ell',m-h(\ell)}}{P_{\ell,m}}{P_{\ell'',m}}\]
      for $m\ge h(\ell)$.
      Lemma~\ref{le:standard AR sequences} gives an exact sequence
      \[\ses{P_{\ell,m}}{P_{i,m}\oplus P_{\ell'',m}}{P_{\ell,m+1}}\]
      which reduces to the desired sequence using Lemma~\ref{le:sequence reducing}.
    \item If $\ell\in Q_0(-,i)$ and $\ell''\in Q_0(\ell,-)$, then $h(\ell'')=h(\ell)-1$ and by induction we obtain an exact sequence
      \[\ses{P_{\ell',m-h(\ell)}}{P_{\ell,m-1}}{P_{\ell'',m}}\]
      for $m-1\ge h(\ell)-1$.
      Lemma~\ref{le:standard AR sequences} gives an exact sequence
      \[\ses{P_{\ell,m-1}}{P_{i,m}\oplus P_{\ell'',m}}{P_{\ell,m}}\]
      which reduces to the desired sequence using Lemma~\ref{le:sequence reducing}.
    \item If $\ell\in Q_0(-,i)$ and $\ell''\in Q_0(-,\ell)$, then $h(\ell'')=h(\ell)-1$ and by induction we obtain an exact sequence
      \[\ses{P_{\ell',m-h(\ell)}}{P_{\ell,m-1}}{P_{\ell'',m-1}}\]
      for $m-1\ge h(\ell)-1$.
      Lemma~\ref{le:standard AR sequences} gives an exact sequence
      \[\ses{P_{\ell,m-1}}{P_{i,m}\oplus P_{\ell'',m-1}}{P_{\ell,m}}\]
      which reduces to the desired sequence using Lemma~\ref{le:sequence reducing}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

For $i\in Q_0$ and $m\ge0$, given $\ell\in Q_0(-,i)\cup Q_0(i,-)$ we write $\cI_{i,m}^{\{\ell\}}\subset\cI_{i,m}$ for the tuple of subspaces with the only proper subspace at position $\ell$ and the zero subspace in that component.
\begin{corollary}
  \label{cor:reduced sequences}
  Suppose $i\in Q_0$ is adjacent to a limb vertex $\ell$ with associated leaf $\ell'$.
  Then there is an exact sequence
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:reduced AR}
    \ses{P_{\ell',m-h(\ell)}}{\cP_{i,m}\bullet\cI_{i,m}^{\{\ell\}}}{P_{i,m+1}}.
  \end{equation}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  This is immediate by applying Lemma~\ref{le:sequence reducing} to the sequences from Corollary~\ref{cor:thin sequences} and Lemma~\ref{le:standard AR sequences}.
\end{proof}

The following result is crucial to the constructions to follow.
\begin{lemma}
  Consider $i\in Q_0$ and $m\ge0$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For any tuple of subspaces $\cV\subsetneq\cI_{i,-1}$, the natural evaluation map $\cP_{i,-1}\bullet\cV\to P_{i,0}$ is injective.
    \item For any admissible tuple $\cV\subsetneq\cI_{i,m}$, the natural evaluation map $\cP_{i,m}\bullet\cV\to P_{i,m+1}$ is injective.
    \item The sequence \eqref{eq:preprojective AR} induces isomorphisms 
      \[\Irr(P_{k,m},P_{i,m+1})^*\cong \Irr(P_{i,m},P_{k,m}) \qquad \text{and} \qquad \Irr(P_{j,m+1},P_{i,m+1})^*\cong \Irr(P_{i,m},P_{j,m+1})\]
      for each $k\in Q_0(-,i)$ and each $j\in Q_0(i,-)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Part (1) immediately follows from the exactness of the sequence \eqref{eq:projective AR}.
  Thus for an admissible tuple~$\cV\subsetneq\cI_{i,-1}$, say with $V_j\subset\Irr(P_{j,0},P_{i,0})$ in the $j$-th component, we have an exact commutative diagram:
  \[\xymatrix{
      & 0 \ar[d] & 0 \ar[d] & & \\
      0 \ar[r] & \bigoplus\limits_{j\in Q_0(i,-)} P_{j,0}\otimes V_j \ar@{=}[r] \ar[d] & \bigoplus\limits_{j\in Q_0(i,-)} P_{j,0}\otimes V_j \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0 \ar[d] & \\
      0 \ar[r] & \bigoplus\limits_{j\in Q_0(i,-)} P_{j,0}\otimes\Irr(P_{j,0},P_{i,0}) \ar[r]\ar[d] & P_{i,0} \ar[r]\ar[d] & S_i \ar[r]\ar@{=}[d] & 0 \\
      0 \ar[r] & \bigoplus\limits_{j\in Q_0(i,-)} P_{j,0}\otimes\big(\Irr(P_{j,0},P_{i,0})/V_j\big) \ar[r]\ar[d] & C \ar[r]\ar[d] & S_i \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0 \\
      & 0 & 0 & 0 & 
    }
  \]
  
  Part (2) is trivial if $\cV$ has all components zero, so we assume this is not the case.
  First observe that after an APR-tilt (applying a sequence of reflection functors) it suffices to show in the case $m=-1$ with vertex $i=n$ the unique source of $Q$ that the representation $C$ in the diagram above contains no preinjective summands.

  There are two cases to consider.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Assume $\bigoplus\limits_{j\in Q_0(i,-)} P_{j,0}\otimes\big(\Irr(P_{j,0},P_{i,0})/V_j\big)$ contains a summand $P_{\ell,0}$ for $\ell\in Q_0(n,-)$ which is not a limb with reprect to the source vertex $n$.
      Then the result follows by induction using Lemma~\ref{le:nonlimb extensions} and Lemma~\ref{le:nonpreinjective extensions}.
    \item Assume all summands of $\bigoplus\limits_{j\in Q_0(i,-)} P_{j,0}\otimes\big(\Irr(P_{j,0},P_{i,0})/V_j\big)$ correspond to vertices which are limbs with respect to $n$, say $V_j=0$ exactly for $j\in\{i_1,\ldots,i_q\}$.
      Since $\cV$ is admissible, we must have $q\ge2$.
  \end{itemize}

  A simple homological calculation shows that $\End(C)\cong\End(P_{i,0})$ is one-dimensional.
  Therefore $C$ must be indecomposable and hence preinjective.
  Thus there exists $k\in Q_0$ with $C\cong \tau^r\Sigma_n\cdots \Sigma_{k+1} S_k$ for some $r\ge0$.

  Note that the lower horizontal sequence in the diagram above shows that $C$ contains a one-dimensional space at vertex $n$.
  As $C$ has a one-dimensional space at vertex $n$, this implies there is a unique path in $Q$ from vertex $k$ to vertex $n$.
  Since $\cV\subsetneq\cI_{n,-1}$ is a proper subspace, $C$ contains a projective subrepresentation and so vertex $k$ must be a sink in $Q$.
  
  
  are two cases to consider.
  We need to verify that $\cV$ being admissible implies that $P_{i,0}/\cP_{i,-1}\bullet\cV$ contains no preinjective summands.
  This then implies the statement of part (2) by applying reflection functors.

  By Lemma~\ref{le:preprojective ext groups}, we have $\Ext(\cP_{i,m}\bullet\cV,P_{i,m})=0$.
  Thus, by taking pullbacks, we obtain a commutative diagram 
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r] & P_{i,m}\ar@{=}[d]\ar[r] & P_{i,m}\oplus \cP_{i,m}\bullet\cV \ar@{}[dr]|(.7){\lrcorner} \ar[r]\ar[d]_{(\iota_{i,m},\mathrm{id}_{\cP_{i,m}}\bullet\iota_\cV)} & \cP_{i,m}\bullet\cV \ar[r]\ar_{ev_\cV}[d] & 0\\
  0 \ar[r] & P_{i,m}\ar[r]^{\iota_{i,m}} & \cP_{i,m}\bullet \cI_{i,m} \ar[r]^{ev} & P_{i,m+1} \ar[r] & 0}\]
  in which we set $P_0=0$ and $I_l=0$ for $l\leq 0$.
  Since $\mathrm{id}_{P_1}\otimes \iota_V$ is injective, the snake lemma shows that $\ker(ev_V)=0$ for $m=1$ and thus $ev_V$ is injective in this case.
  
  In view of Remark~\ref{rem:reflection recursion}, it is enough for the case $m>1$ to show that the cokernel of $ev_V$ does not have a preinjective direct summand when $m=1$.
  Clearly the cokernel of $\mathrm{id}_{P_1}\otimes \iota_V$ is isomorphic to $P_1\otimes \cH_1/V$.
  Thus we obtain the following commutative diagram induced by the cokernels of the above vertical maps, note that the vertical maps below are surjective:
  \[\xymatrix{0 \ar[r]  & P_1\otimes \cH_1 \ar[d]\ar[r]^{ev} &P_{2}\ar[d] \ar[r] & I_{1}\ar@{=}[d]\ar[r]&0\\ 0\ar[r] & P_1\otimes \cH_1/V \ar[r] &K\ar[r]& I_{1}\ar[r]&0.}\]

  We need to show that $K$ has no preinjective direct summand.
  As $\Hom(P_2,P_1)=0$ and as the vertical maps are surjective, the representation $K$ has no direct summand which is isomorphic to $P_1=S_1$.
  But this already shows that $K$ is indecomposable as $\udim K=(\dim \cH_1/V,1)$.
  Since $V$ is a proper subspace of $\cH_1$, $\udim K$ is not the dimension vector of a preinjective representation and the claim follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  For $i\in Q_0$, $m\in\ZZ_{\ge0}$, and $\cV\subsetneq\cI_{i,m}$, define the \emph{truncated preprojective} representation $P_{i,m+1}^\cV=P_{i,m+1}/\cP_{i,m}\bullet\cV$.
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}
  Consider $\cV\subsetneq\cI_{i,m}$ with $\codim_{\cI_{i,m}}(\cV)=1$, say $\cP_{i,m}\bullet\cI_{i,m}/\cP_{i,m}\bullet\cV\cong P_{\ell,n}$ with $n=m$ or $n=m+1$.
  Then $P_{i,m+1}^\cV\cong P_{\ell,n}^{\overline{\cV}}$, where $\overline{\cV}=..$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  There is a commutative diagram of the following form:
  \[\xymatrix{
      & & 0 \ar[d] & 0 \ar[d] \\
      & & \cP_{i,m}\bullet\cV \ar[d]\ar@{=}[r] & \cP_{i,m}\bullet\cV \ar[d] \\
      0 \ar[r] & P_{i,m} \ar[r]\ar@{=}[d] & \cP_{i,m}\bullet\cI_{i,m}  \ar[d]\ar[r] & P_{i,m+1} \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0\\
      0 \ar[r] & P_{i,m} \ar[r] & P_{\ell,n} \ar[r]\ar[d] & P_{i,m+1}^\cV \ar[r]\ar[d] & 0 \\
      & & 0 & 0}\]
  It follows that we may identify $P_{i,m+1}^\cV$ with a truncated preprojective $P_{\ell,n}^{\overline{\cV}}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{le:sequence reducing}
  Suppose there is a exact sequence 
  \[\ses{A}{X\oplus B}{C}\]
  for which the induced map $f:A\to B$ given by composing the left hand morphism with the natural projection is surjective.
  Then there is an induced short exact sequence 
  \[\ses{K}{X}{C},\]
  where $K=\ker(f)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Consider the following exact commutative diagram:

  The middle vertical sequence is naturally split which induces the upper horizontal morphism and shows that it is injective.
  Since the lower horizontal morphism is an equality, the upper left square is a pushout.
  It follows that the cokernel of the upper horizontal morphism coincides with the cokernel in the middle horizontal sequence, giving the claim.

\section{$\CC^*$-equivariant Caldero-Chapoton Maps}
The ideas presented here assume that we have already constructed a cell decomposition by combining the Bia\l{}ynicki-Birula cells coming from $\CC^*$-actions with the inductive construction of cell decompositions for lifts to the universal covering quiver.
